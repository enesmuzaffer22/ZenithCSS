# ZenithCSS

ZenithCSS is a software project developed in the .NET Desktop Form environment. This project allows users to create HTML and CSS components through a visual interface. Users can select basic web components such as buttons, links (`<a>`), and text inputs (`input` type="text") and customize their style properties. These style properties include settings such as padding, background color, text color, and hover color.

With its user-friendly interface, ZenithCSS makes it easy to create and customize web components without the need for technical knowledge. Once users design their desired component, the project automatically generates the HTML and CSS output for it. This makes ZenithCSS an ideal solution for those who want to quickly and efficiently create customized web elements and use them in their projects.
